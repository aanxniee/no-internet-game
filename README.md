# ðŸ¦– No Internet Game

Original credit to Google. Player must jump/crouch to avoid obstacles. This remake version is made using Python and Pygame. Designed as a part of my curriculum for TAC/LSA Coding/3D Printing students. Aims to transition them from Scratch and block-based to OOP and text-based programming. Teaches sprites, FPS, game states, and objects/classes.
